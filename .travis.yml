# Todo: the Travis OS seems to fool the automatic detection for C++11
# support, so CXXFLAGS="-std=c++0x" is required here. This is
# done in O2scl's Travis CI settings page.

# Todo: Try adding eigen and armadillo support

  # need to use '-v' for brew install so that the build doesn't
  # timeout.
