# Todo: Right now, we check only the current version, not the latest dist.
#
# Todo: the Travis OS seems to fool the automatic detection for C++11
# support, so CXXFLAGS="-std=c++0x" is required here. This is
# done in O2scl's Travis CI settings page.
#
# Todo: Try adding eigen, armadillo, openmp, HDF5 compression support
