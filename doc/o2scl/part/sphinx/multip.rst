Multiprecision Support
======================

:ref:`O2scl_part <o2sclp>`

Multiprecision support for :ref:`O2scl_part <o2sclp>` classes is in
progress. The data classes :ref:`thermo_tl <thermo_tl>` and
:ref:`part_tl <part_tl>` are templates and can be built on any
floating-point type. The :ref:`classical_thermo_tl
<classical_thermo_tl>` class for classical thermodynamics also support
multiprecision types.
