	* Version 0.805
	* Updates and better documentation of the examples
	* Fixed several classes so they are properly purely virtual
	* Updated linear algebra routines to allow either
	operator[] or operator().
	* Created a new file src/base/vector.h to make the class
	organization a little more transparent.
	* Updated to autoconf v. 2.61
	* Updated the adaptive ODE steppers to provide error information
	* Updated nuclear masses
	* Added a sort_unique() function for ovector and uvector classes.

2008-03-08  Andrew W. Steiner  <awsteiner@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.804
	* Created directory src/linalg which includes several linear
	algebra routines including LU, QR, householder, and tridiagonal 
	solvers for generic vector and matrix types. 
	* Fixes to rel_boson, eff_boson, cern_adapt, and cern_gauss56,
	tov_eos, eff_fermion, ode_iv_solve, and tov_solve
	* Fixed adding ./ in examples makefile
	* Updated some of the constants based on the new NIST info
	* Added << operator for permutation class
	* Several documentation updates
	* Updated gsl_mroot_hybrids
	* Reworked o2scl-test to use libtool

2008-01-01  Andrew W. Steiner  <awsteiner@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.803
	* Created permutation class (as with the vector and matrix
	classes, it is compatible with the gsl_permutation struct)
	* Updated gsl_miser to properly generalize vector types
	* Created new classes based on the Open Optimization Library (OOL)
	which perfom constrained minimization.
	* Several documentation updates

2007-12-07  Andrew W. Steiner  <awsteiner@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.802
	* Several documentation additions and changes
	* Updated gsl_monte, gsl_vegas and gsl_anneal to 
	properly generalize vector types.
	* Added statistics functions for generic vector types analogous
	to the corresponding GSL stat functions
	* Small fixes in gsl_rkck and gsl_rk8pd
	* Improvements in tensor, more documentation, and made a fix
	in the interpolation
	* Updated range checking
	* Improved compilation on Cygwin

2007-10-26  Andrew W. Steiner  <awsteiner@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.801
	* Several documentation additions and changes
	* Updated twod_intp, ode_iv_solve, gsl_astep
	* Added a n-dimensional tensor class, and the class tensor_grid,
	which allows naive n-dimesional interpolation
	* Added pointer_2d_alloc and updated the vector/matrix allocation 
	objects
	* Added last_iter to some of the integrators to keep track of 
	the number of iterations last used
	* Removed snprintf and mkstemp for more compatibility

2007-10-03  Andrew W. Steiner  <awsteiner@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 0.8 released on SourceForge
