/** \page unitconv_section Unit Conversions

    There is a class which performs conversion between units specified
    with strings in \ref o2scl::convert_units. If <tt>popen()</tt> is
    supported then the class can use a <tt>system()</tt> call to GNU
    units to obtain the proper conversion factors. Unit conversions
    are cached so that future requests of the same conversion factor
    don't require additional <tt>system()</tt> calls.
