    This set of guidelines is intended for \o2 developers.

    This page is primarily designed as an internal section for
    developers only, while related sections in the User's guide are
    aimed at advanced end-users.

    <b>Release procedure</b>
    - Make sure version numbers are updated in configure.ac, 
    doc/o2scl/doxyfile, doc/o2scl/main.dox, snap/snapcraft.yaml, 
    and tables in dl_page.dox
    are updated with "not yet set" for the new version hashes.
    - For most recent commit, make sure the tests, examples, and
    documentation all succeed. Check source installs on ubuntu and
    OS X and a homebrew HEAD install.
    - Try a test build on travis-ci.org
    - Make sure snaps are working using 
    <tt>sudo snapcraft -d cleanbuild</tt>
    - Update NEWS file with recent changes.
    - Make the final commit targeted for release. 
    - Check the commit succeeds on travis-ci.org
    - Promote the snaps on snapcraft from edge to beta
    at https://snapcraft.io/o2scl/releases .
    - Refresh the documentation using <tt>make o2scl-doc</tt>.
    - Create the new distribution and copy to internal svn repo.
    - Create github release, tagging the recent commit and uploading
    the distribution.
    - Compute hashes with <tt>md5sum</tt> and <tt>openssl dgst -sha256</tt>
    and update dl_page.dox with hashes and github
    release hash. Regenerate documentation with <tt>make o2scl-doc</tt>.
    - Do a 'make install' on isospin so that 'make utk-sync-doc'
    can copy docs from the post-installation directory
    - Copy the new distribution and the new sha256 hash to 
    https://isospin.roam.utk.edu/public_data/o2scl_dists/
    - Update homebrew recipe with the new version number and new hash.
    - Check installation using homebrew directly.
    - Turn on build pushes in travis-ci.org and commit again since
    dl_page.dox has changed. 

    <b>Procedure for moving to new development version:</b>
    - Update to the new development version number and new OLIB numbers
    in configure.ac .
    - Update version numbers in doxyfile files and main.dox files
    and in dl_page.dox .
    - Update local configure scripts to refer to new version number
    if necessary
    
    <b>o2sclpy release procedure:</b>
    - Update version numbers in o2sclpy/setup.py and o2sclpy/doc/index.rst
    - Regenerate the o2sclpy documentation using <tt>make doc</tt>
    and upload it to web using <tt>make sync-doc</tt>
    - Remove old dists in o2sclpy by clearing o2sclpy/dist directory
    - Run <tt>python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel</tt>
    - Upload a new version of o2sclpy to pypi using
    <tt>twine upload dist/*</tt>

    <b>Coding recommendations and guidelines:</b>
    - Comment code liberally. 
    - Avoid goto statements.
    - Avoid hard-coded numerical values which are not either:
    (i) well-commented, or (ii) parameters modifiable by a class-user.
    - Match the existing coding style when possible.
    - Make sure all lines fit in 78 columns.
    - Because this is a library (and not a end-user executable),
    it is generally better to call the error handler when an input is 
    incorrectly specified instead of assuming some alternative
    correct value.
    - All new classes deserve new documentation and new testing code.
    - Documentation and code should be in standard American English.
    - All code must be released in GPLv3.
    - Global variables and static member data should be avoided.
    - When reasonable, put input parameters first and output
    parameters last. 
    - When possible, templated vector parameters with size_t arguments
    should appear similar to <tt>size_t &n, vec_t &v</tt>, and in that 
    order.
    - All code should be ANSI-compatible, and, inasmuch as is 
    possible, operating system and platform independent.
    - Exception messages should be as informative as possible.
    - Exception messages should end with the full class and function name
    from where they are thrown.
    - Functions which deallocate memory should never fail and should
    never be required to call the error handler. Also, class
    destructors should never be required to call the error handler.
    - Avoid passing pointers. Pass either bare objects (which then
    require copy constructors), shared pointers, or const references.
    - For numeric parameters to functions, if not all values
    are permissible, then the error handler should be called
    when a non-permissible value is given by the user and the
    function documentation should clearly explain why.
    - Wherever possible, objects should be usable by default.
    Avoid zombie objects which are instantiated but unusable.
    An important exception to this rule is in classes which would
    otherwise have to load data from a file in order to operate
    normally, as file I/O should not occur in constructors
    (so that MPI can instantiate classes without worrying 
    about parallel I/O).
    - Objects should thread-safe in the weak sense, that is, 
    different processes should be able to safely access and modify
    different instances of the same class at any time. Functions 
    which read (but not modify) class data should be thread-safe
    in the strong sense, that is, different processes should be
    able to read the same instance of a class at any time.
    - Whereever possible, ensure your code compiles without
    warnings using flags analogous to the gcc string
    \verbatim
    -ansi -pedantic -Wno-long-long -Wall -Wno-unused -Wextra 
    -Wconversion -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings
    \endverbatim
    - Avoid 'try' blocks, as a goal is that \o2 should compile
    with -fno-exceptions.
    - Functions which return \c void should end with <tt>return;</tt>.
    - All functions which are called by the constructor should be
    documented as doing so 

    <b>Documentation guidelines:</b>
    - Refer to other classes with \\ref if necessary. Refer
    to function parameters with \\c or embed them in html
    TT (text-type) commands.
    - Bibliographic references should be used. When possible,
    include the DOI link which begins with the prefix 
    http://dx.doi.org (not the vendor-specific DOI link). 
    - Comment Doxygen documentation with \\comment and \\endcomment.
    (Yes, sometimes comments in comments are useful.)

    <b>git repository:</b>
    - Communicate with the lead developer before, during, and after
    any non-trivial development. Communicate your ideas before
    development, so that you don't write many lines of code only to
    find that your pull request will be rejected. Communicate your
    ideas during development to avoid conflicting changes. Communicate
    your ideas after development to ensure they have a chance of being
    implmented. Subversion is not a replacement for real
    communication.
    - Pull requests will be integrated into the trunk by the lead
    developer at whatever time they deem appropriate.
    - Developer-specific files which are not platform-independent
    should not be added to the repository. Sometimes
    <tt>.gitignore</tt> can be used to ignore these files, but this
    should be done sparingly.
