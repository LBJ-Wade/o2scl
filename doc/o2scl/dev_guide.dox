    This page is primarily designed as an internal section for
    developers only, while related sections in the User's guide are
    aimed at advanced end-users.

    This set of guidelines is intended for \o2 developers.

    <b>General coding guidelines:</b>
    - Comment code liberally. 
    - Avoid goto statements.
    - Avoid hard-coded numerical values which are not either:
    (i) well-commented, or (ii) parameters modifiable by a class-user.
    - Match the existing coding style when possible.
    - Make sure all lines fit in 78 columns.
    - Because this is a library (and not a end-user executable),
    it is generally better to call the error handler when an input is 
    incorrectly specified instead of assuming some alternative
    correct value.
    - All new classes deserve new documentation and new testing code.
    - Documentation and code should be in standard American English.
    - All code must be released in GPLv3.
    - Global variables and static member data should be avoided.
    - When reasonable, put input parameters first and output
    parameters last. 
    - When possible, templated vector parameters with size_t arguments
    should appear similar to <tt>size_t &n, vec_t &v</tt>, and in that 
    order.
    - All code should be ANSI-compatible, and, inasmuch as is 
    possible, operating system and platform independent.
    - Exception messages should be as informative as possible.
    - Exception messages should end with the full class and function name
    from where they are thrown.
    - Functions which deallocate memory should never fail and should
    never be required to call the error handler. Also, class
    destructors should never be required to call the error handler.
    - Avoid passing pointers. Pass either bare objects (which then
    require copy constructors), shared pointers, or const references.
    - For numeric parameters to functions, if not all values
    are permissible, then the error handler should be called
    when a non-permissible value is given by the user and the
    function documentation should clearly explain why.
    - Wherever possible, objects should be usable by default.
    Avoid zombie objects which are instantiated but unusable.
    An important exception to this rule is in classes which would
    otherwise have to load data from a file in order to operate
    normally, as file I/O should not occur in constructors
    (so that MPI can instantiate classes without worrying 
    about parallel I/O).
    - Objects should thread-safe in the weak sense, that is, 
    different processes should be able to safely access and modify
    different instances of the same class at any time. Functions 
    which read (but not modify) class data should be thread-safe
    in the strong sense, that is, different processes should be
    able to read the same instance of a class at any time.
    - Whereever possible, ensure your code compiles without
    warnings using flags analogous to the gcc string
    \verbatim
    -ansi -pedantic -Wno-long-long -Wall -Wno-unused -Wextra 
    -Wconversion -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings
    \endverbatim
    - Avoid 'try' blocks, as a goal is that \o2 should compile
    with -fno-exceptions.
    - Functions which return \c void should end with <tt>return;</tt>.
    - All functions which are called by the constructor should be
    documented as doing so 

    <b>Documentation guidelines:</b>
    - Refer to other classes with \\ref if necessary. Refer
    to function parameters with \\c or embed them in html
    TT (text-type) commands.
    - Bibliographic references should be used. When possible,
    include the DOI link which begins with the prefix 
    http://dx.doi.org (not the vendor-specific DOI link). 
    - Comment Doxygen documentation with \\comment and \\endcomment.
    (Yes, sometimes comments in comments are useful.)

    <b>Patches:</b>
    - For those who are uncomfortable with Subversion, patches are
    always accepted.
    - Prepare patches based on the most recent version of the
    trunk or the appropriate branch.
    
    <b>SVN:</b>
    - Editing the trunk directly should be avoided. Most development
    should occur on branches, to be merged with the trunk at the
    appropriate time. 
    - Ideally the trunk should always compile and all the tests should
    pass.
    - Communicate with the lead developer before, during, and after any
    non-trivial development. Communicate your ideas before development,
    so that you don't write many lines of code only to find that your new
    code will be rejected. Communicate your ideas during development to
    avoid conflicting changes. Communicate your ideas after development
    to ensure they have a chance of being implmented. Subversion is 
    not a replacement for real communication.
    - Commit often.
    - Merge carefully. If you fail to merge correctly, code added
    by other developers will be (at least temporarily) lost.
    - Branches will be merged into the trunk by the lead developer
    at whatever time they deem appropriate.
    - Developer-specific files which are not platform-independent
    should not be added to the repository. Sometimes svn:ignore can
    be used to ignore these files, but this should be done 
    sparingly.
