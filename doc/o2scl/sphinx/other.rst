Other Classes and Functions
===========================

:ref:`O2scl <o2scl>`

The \o2 library contains several classes which are still under
development and are to be considered experimental. While it is
expected that the testing code associated with these classes will
succeed on most any system, the interface, structure, and basic
approaches used by these classes may change in future versions of
\o2.

<b>Three-dimensional data tables</b> - \ref o2scl::table3d \n
\b Series \b acceleration - \ref o2scl::series_acc \n
\b Command-line \b interface - \ref o2scl::cli \n
\b Polylogarithms - \ref o2scl::polylog \n
