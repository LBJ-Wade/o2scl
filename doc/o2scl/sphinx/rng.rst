Random Number Generation
========================

.. note:: The O\ :sub:`2`\ scl random number generators are being
	  deprecated in favor of the C++11 generators, which are used
	  automatically if ``O2SCL_CPP11`` is defined.
	  
A GSL-based random number generator is given in :ref:`rng_gsl
<rng_gsl>` and is still currently used by some O\ :sub:`2`\ scl
classes.
