Random Number Generation
========================

\note The \o2 random number generators are being deprecated in
favor of the C++11 generators, which are used automatically if
<tt>O2SCL_CPP11</tt> is defined.

A GSL-based random number generator is given in \ref o2scl::rng_gsl 
and is still currently used by some \o2 classes.
