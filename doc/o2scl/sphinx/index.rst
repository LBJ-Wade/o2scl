Object-oriented Scientific Computing Library
============================================

O\ :sub:`2`\ scl is a C++ library for object-oriented scientific
computing. It includes interpolation, differentiation, integration,
roots of polynomials, equation solving, minimization, Monte Carlo
integration, simulated annealing, least-squares fitting, solution of
ordinary differential equations, two-dimensional interpolation,
Chebyshev approximation, unit conversions, file I/O with HDF5, and
more.

This is a beta version. The library should install and test
successfully, and most of the classes are ready for production use.
Some of the interfaces may change slightly in future versions. There
are a few classes which are more experimental, and this is stated at
the top of the documentation for these classes.
