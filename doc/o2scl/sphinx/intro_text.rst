O\ :sub:`2`\ scl is a C++ library for object-oriented numerical
programming. It includes interpolation, differentiation, integration,
roots of polynomials, equation solving, minimization, constrained
minimization, Monte Carlo integration, simulated annealing,
least-squares fitting, solution of ordinary differential equations,
two-dimensional interpolation, Chebyshev approximation, unit
conversions, and file I/O with HDF5.

This is a beta version. The library should install and test
successfully, and most of the classes are ready for production use.
Some of the interfaces may change slightly in future versions. There
are a few classes which are more experimental, and this is clearly
stated at the top of the documentation for these classes.
