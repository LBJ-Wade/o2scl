Algebraic Function Evaluation
=============================

The cpp-expression-parser from Brandon Amos is used in \o2 to
provide evaluation of functions specified as strings. The
source code for this library is included in the \o2 
distribution and automatically compiled and installed
with \o2 . See \ref o2scl::calculator .
